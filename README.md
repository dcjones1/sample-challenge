Alright Shinik, I need your help! My program is broken and I can't figure out why.

All the files needed are there. The cards work properly and I know I'm getting the right information from the API. Maybe my props aren't working properly.

Once all the characters are displaying, I want to sort them using the buttons you see on the screen. I also have a search bar that I would love to be able to search characters by their name. As soon as I type, I want to narrow down the list by name.

Finally, I want to be able to choose my team for an adventure. When I click on the card of the character, I want them to be moved over to my team and NOT be in the full list. When I click them in my team, I want them to be removed.

Remember: the app WILL start off broken. This is okay, use your skills to get it working, then get the deliverables going!

Deliverables:
  - all characters should dislay in a card
  - characters can be sorted using the available buttons
  - characters can be searched by their name using the search bar
  - onClick, a character should move from the all characters container to the team container. When clicked again, they move from the team back to all characters.

Some components are functional, some are classes. Do whatever you need to make it work!

**All styling is done!! Basically ignore it and everything should look somewhat nice.
